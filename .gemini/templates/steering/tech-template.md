*   **Key Libraries/Tools**:
    *   [e.g., Zod, Pydantic (for data validation)]
    *   [e.g., Jest, Pytest, GoConvey (for testing)]
    *   [e.g., Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation/analysis)]
    *   [e.g., WebSockets, gRPC (for communication protocols)]

## 3. Development Environment & Tooling
[Describe the tools and environment used for development, building, testing, and managing the project.]

*   **Package Manager**:
    *   [e.g., npm, yarn (JavaScript/TypeScript)]
    *   [e.g., pip, poetry (Python)]
    *   [e.g., cargo (Rust)]
    *   [e.g., go mod (Go)]
*   **Build Tools**:
    *   [e.g., Vite, Webpack, Rollup (JavaScript/TypeScript)]
    *   [e.g., tsc (TypeScript compiler)]
    *   [e.g., make (general-purpose build automation)]
    *   [e.g., go build (Go compiler)]
    *   [e.g., Docker (containerization)]
*   **Version Control**: [e.g., Git]
*   **CI/CD**: [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI]

### Common Commands
[List frequently used commands for development, testing, and building the project.]

*   `[package_manager] install`: Install dependencies. (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `go mod tidy`, `cargo build`)
*   `[run_command] dev`: Run the development server/process. (e.g., `npm run dev`, `python main.py --dev`, `go run main.go`)
*   `[test_command]`: Run tests. (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`, `cargo test`)
*   `[build_command]`: Build the project. (e.g., `npm run build`, `make build`, `go build -o myapp`, `cargo build --release`)
*   `[lint_command]`: Run linter/formatter. (e.g., `npm run lint`, `ruff check .`, `gofmt -w .`)

## 4. Technical Decisions & Rationale
[Document significant technical decisions made during the project and the reasoning behind them. Include alternatives considered and why the chosen technology/pattern was preferred.]

*   **[Technology/Pattern Choice]**: [Why this was chosen, alternatives considered, and the trade-offs involved.]
    *   *Example:* **Decision:** Use FastAPI for the backend API.
    *   *Rationale:* Chosen for its high performance, automatic OpenAPI documentation generation, and strong type hinting support, which aligns with our team's Python expertise and desire for rapid API development. Alternatives like Django REST Framework were considered but deemed too heavy for this microservice's scope.
    *   *Example:* **Decision:** Implement the CLI using Go's Cobra library.
    *   *Rationale:* Cobra provides robust command-line parsing and sub-command management, and Go's static compilation allows for easy distribution of a single binary without runtime dependencies, which is ideal for a CLI tool. Python's Click was an alternative but would require Python runtime installation.
