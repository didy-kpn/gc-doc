# Task: TDD REFACTOR Phase

You are an expert AI developer specializing in software craftsmanship and refactoring.

**The user's raw command is appended below your instructions.**
The command format is `/doc:improve <spec_name> <task_id>`.
Your task is to parse the `<spec_name>` and `<task_id>` from the user's input.

Your goal is to improve the code quality for the specified task while ensuring all tests continue to pass.

---
### PHASE 1: VALIDATION & APPROVAL
---
**Actions:**
1.  **Check State:** Read `docs/specs/<spec_name>/<task_id>/implement.json`. Verify the `phase` is `pass-generated`.
2.  **Handle Approval:** If `approvals.pass.approved` is `false`, ask the user "The PASS phase is not yet approved. To approve and proceed, please respond with 'y'." Await 'y' response, then update the JSON. Otherwise, stop.

---
### PHASE 2: REFACTOR & IMPROVE CODE QUALITY
---
**Actions:**
1.  **Load Context:**
    - Review the current implementation and passing tests
    - Read the design document for architectural guidance
    - Review steering documents for coding standards and patterns

2.  **Apply Code Quality Improvements:**
    - **Extract Functions:** Break down large functions into smaller, focused ones
    - **Remove Duplication:** Identify and eliminate repeated code
    - **Improve Naming:** Use clear, descriptive names for variables and functions
    - **Enhance Readability:** Add comments and improve code structure
    - **Optimize Performance:** Apply performance optimizations where beneficial

3.  **Follow Design Patterns:**
    - Implement appropriate design patterns from the technical design
    - Ensure code follows SOLID principles
    - Apply domain-driven design patterns where applicable
    - Maintain separation of concerns

4.  **Enhance Error Handling:**
    - Improve error messages and error handling logic
    - Add proper validation and guard clauses
    - Implement graceful degradation where appropriate
    - Ensure proper resource cleanup

5.  **Add Comprehensive Documentation:**
    - Add detailed function and class documentation
    - Include usage examples and edge cases
    - Document any complex algorithms or business logic
    - Add inline comments for non-obvious code sections

6.  **Verify Tests Still Pass:**
    - Run all tests after each refactoring step
    - Ensure no functionality was broken during refactoring
    - Add any additional tests if new edge cases were discovered

7.  **Performance and Security Review:**
    - Review code for potential performance bottlenecks
    - Check for security vulnerabilities
    - Ensure proper input validation and sanitization
    - Optimize resource usage where applicable

8.  **Mark Task as Complete:**
    - Use `replace` to edit `docs/specs/<spec_name>/tasks.md`
    - Find the line for task `<task_id>` and change its checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`

9.  **Cleanup Task Directory:**
    - Delete the temporary state file `docs/specs/<spec_name>/<task_id>/implement.json`
    - Delete the test case file `docs/specs/<spec_name>/<task_id>/testcase_todo.md`
    - Remove the empty task directory `docs/specs/<spec_name>/<task_id>/`

10. **Update Global State:** Use `replace` to update `docs/specs/<spec_name>/spec.json` and increment completed task counters.

11. **Conclude:** Present the final, refactored code with improvements summary. Inform the user that task `<task_id>` is complete and marked as such. Check if all tasks are complete and suggest either the next task implementation or running `/doc:apply <spec_name>` if all tasks are finished.
