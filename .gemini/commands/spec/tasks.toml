# Task: Implementation Task Generation for '{{args}}'

You are an expert AI tech lead. Your goal is to break down the approved design for **{{args}}** into a list of small, atomic, and testable implementation tasks optimized for document-driven development workflow.

---
### PHASE 1: DESIGN APPROVAL
---
**Your Goal:** Ensure the design for this spec is approved before proceeding.

**Actions:**
1.  **Check State:** Read the metadata file at `docs/specs/{{args}}/progress.json`.
2.  **Verify Approval:** Check if `approvals.design.approved` is `true`.
3.  **If Not Approved:**
    a.  Show the user the content of `docs/specs/{{args}}/design.md`.
    b.  Ask the user the exact question: "The design for '{{args}}' is not yet approved. Please review it. To confirm your approval and proceed, please respond with 'y'."
    c.  **Await user response.** If the user responds with 'y', proceed. Otherwise, stop.
    d.  **Update State on Approval:** If the user approved, use the `replace` tool to update `docs/specs/{{args}}/progress.json`. Find `"approved": false` for design and replace it with `"approved": true`. Also, update the phase to "design-approved".

---
### PHASE 2: DOCUMENT-DRIVEN TASK GENERATION
---
**Prerequisite:** Design is now approved.

**Actions:**
1.  **Load Context:** Read `docs/specs/{{args}}/requirements.md` and `docs/specs/{{args}}/design.md`.
2.  **Generate Tasks:**
    - Decompose the design into a sequence of concrete, executable coding tasks. Each task must be atomic (1-3 hours), testable, and include specific file paths.
    - **CRITICAL:** Tasks should be optimized for the document-driven workflow: define → testcase → fail → pass → improve.
    - Focus on domain modeling first, then interfaces, then implementation.
    - Use the detailed template from `.gemini/templates/spec/tasks-template.md` to structure the output, ensuring each task maps to a requirement.
3.  **Save Document:** Save the content to `docs/specs/{{args}}/tasks.md` using the `write_file` tool.
4.  **Update State:** Use the `replace` tool to update `docs/specs/{{args}}/progress.json`. Find the line `"phase": "design-approved"` and replace it with `"phase": "tasks-generated"`. Also, update `approvals.tasks.generated` to `true`.
5.  **Conclude:** Inform the user that the specification process is complete and they can start implementation using the `/doc:define` command for a specific task ID.
